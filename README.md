🚦 Unix 3D-Real-Time Simulation : AI Railway Control System

This project is a portable real-time simulation system with WebGL UI, fully automated and built using Bash on MSYS2 (or native Linux). It showcases how minimal dependencies can power modern, interactive, and intelligent control systems. ⚙️🧠
Unix & Bash aren't just for server management—they can orchestrate entire complex full-stack applications with artificial intelligence, immersive 3D graphics, voice notifications, and persistent data, all with under 30 seconds of setup time!

🧠 Why it's mind-blowing:

✅ Cutting-Edge AI: Real-time collision prevention, optimized route management, and deadlock resolution!

✅ Self-Generating Frontend: The entire JavaScript frontend (Three.js, PHP, SQLite, logic, UI) is embedded and generated directly by the Bash script into index.php! 🤯

✅ Immersive 3D Simulation: Track trains, signals, and stations in a dynamic, responsive 3D environment.

✅ Voice Notification System: Real-time auditory alerts for overspeeding trains, intrusions, and anomalies (yes, it talks!). 🗣️🚨

✅ 100% Portable: Downloads PHP, configures everything, runs instantly on MSYS2.

✅ External Sensor Integration: Monitors track temperature, vibrations, and camera status, reacting to threats.

✅ Advanced Reporting: Dashboard with performance metrics and one-click report generation.

🔥 What you get:

    Realistic 3D simulation with real-time train control.
    Intuitive interface and instantly updated data.
    Sound and voice alerts for critical events.
    Intelligent train priority management (Passenger, High-Speed, Freight).
    Detailed visualization of AI decisions in real-time.
    Persistent storage with an integrated SQLite database, zero setup!

🚀 How to try it:
bash railway-ai-control.sh

Then launch:
http://localhost:8080

👀 What you’ll see:

A smart simulation of a railway control system, complete with train movement, alerts, AI decisions, and UI built on-the-fly. Perfect to demonstrate real-time logic, embedded tech, and system monitoring.

🧩 Relevance

Whether gate automation, transport systems, or surveillance dashboards – this project shows how much can be done with minimal assumptions, high adaptability, and strong cross-platform tooling.

💬 Let’s talk about how this approach can enhance modularity, testing, and rapid prototyping in your stack.

🧰 Technical Description

This project was developed as a fully automated and portable simulation system for railway traffic control, aiming to showcase full-stack skills using minimal dependencies and rapid setup.

Main Components:

    Technologies used:
    
        Bash scripting (MSYS2/Windows/Linux)
        WebGL for dynamic browser-based visual feedback (no libraries required – pure HTML/JS)
        PHP 8.x with built-in server
        SQLite3 (embedded, no external database)
        HTML + dynamically generated UI

    Functionality:

        Real-time simulation of railway traffic events
        Dynamic web interface rendered on first run
        AI logic for randomized conditions (e.g., weather, delays, incidents)
        Local data persistence

    Design goals:

        Zero-config setup from a single .sh script
        Cross-platform compatibility using MSYS2
        Modularity and clean separation between logic, UI, and data
        Fully offline-capable once downloaded

This approach demonstrates practical skills in backend automation, frontend generation, and embedded system logic, all relevant to scenarios like transport monitoring, gate automation, or intelligent surveillance.

🐧 Addendum – How to Run It on Linux

Although originally designed for MSYS2 on Windows, this script runs smoothly on any modern Linux distribution with Bash and a few basic tools.

✅ Prerequisites:

    Bash shell (default)

    curl, unzip, sqlite3, php (≥ 8.x)

🔧 Quick setup (example on Ubuntu/Debian):

sudo apt install curl unzip php sqlite3
bash railway-ai-control.sh

Then open:
http://localhost:8080

Everything else is handled by the script – no web server or manual config needed. Just run and explore the simulation!

    Shell                  Bash (via MSYS2)                          Native Bash
    PHP                    Available via pacman -S php               Preinstalled or available via apt/yum
    SQLite3                Available via pacman -S sqlite            Preinstalled or available via apt/yum
    Start Command          bash railway-ai-control.sh                bash railway-ai-control.sh
    Web Server             php -S localhost:8080                     php -S localhost:8080
    Compatibility          ✅ Full with MSYS2                       ✅ Full out of the box
    Web UI                 Opens in default browser (Edge, Chrome)   Opens in Firefox, Chrome, etc.
    Editing Tools          Notepad / VSCode                          nano, vim, VSCode

📌 Key point: the script behaves identically across both platforms with minimal setup, ensuring full portability and quick deployment in Linux-dominant environments.
